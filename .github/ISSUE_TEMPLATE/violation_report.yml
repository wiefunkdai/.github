        ## What constitutes a violation?
        
        The following are some of the violations in question:
        
        - **Copyright Matter**<br>
        Do not include the name or creator or alias of the creator for the use of his work. 
        Even modifying and publishing other people's works and using their personal names (plagiarism).
        *for ex. distribute or modify the source content by removing the owner's copyright mark.*
        
        - **Commercial Purposes**<br>
        Using content for commercial purposes without having permission from the original user.
        *for ex. a developer uses some of the work resources belonging to others and for trading without the permission of the original owner.*

        - **Abuse of Freedom**<br>
        Changing a work according to the needs of society, whether through distortion, mutilation, modification of the work, or anything that is detrimental to the creator's self or reputation
        *for ex. a developer changes the contents of the content and then publishes it, but the results are even worse due to the intentional damage to the image of the content owner.*<br>
