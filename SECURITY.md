## :newspaper: Reporting a Vulnerability
 
Please **DO NOT** file a public issue to report a security vulberability, 
instead send your report privately to [**`wiefunk@stephanusdai.web.id`**](mailto:wiefunk@stephanusdai.web.id)

This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found can be 
[disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) 
to any affected parties.

## :basketball: Safe harbor for Security

Supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
    and interruption or degradation of our services
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
    account holder.
    If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
    immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
    information
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
    to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
*   We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
    constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
    a complaint to law enforcement.
    We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
    party against you

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.

## :trumpet: Supported Versions

Project versions that are currently being supported with security updates vary per project.
Please see specific project repositories for details.
If nothing is specified, only the latest major versions are supported.

## :tada: Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## :sparkler: Comments on this Policy
