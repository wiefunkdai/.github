Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## :bell: How to Get Help

Generally, we do not use GitHub as a support forum. For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please ask on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] instead. By doing so, you are more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you will allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. These should be located in a root `docs/` directory. If there is an example project, explore that to learn how it works to see if you can answer your question.

1. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].** This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may open an issue on GitHub to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines][contributing].

## :book: Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. It is in effect at all times. We expect it to be honored by everyone who contributes to this project. Acting like an asshole will not be tolerated.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event
- Showing empathy towards other participants

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing photography or recording
- Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this event.

## :inbox_tray: Issues and Bug Reports

**DO NOT** use the issue tracker to ask questions; use chat or the forums for
that. Questions posed to the issue tracker will be closed.

All open-source project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a new Issue.

When reporting an issue, please include the following details:

- A narrative description of what you are trying to accomplish.
- The minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue.
- The expected results of exercising that code.
- The actual results received.

For activity of report may ask for additional details: what version of the library you are using, and what IDE version was used to reproduce the issue.

You may also submit a failing test case as a pull request

## :bulb: Asking Quality Questions

Questions can go to [GitHub discussions][chat].

Help us help you!
Spend time framing questions and add links and resources.
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

*   [Talk to a duck][rubberduck]!
*   Don‚Äôt fall for the [XY problem][xy]
*   Find the best answer to your technical question, help others
    answer theirs in [stackoverflow][stackoverflow]
*   Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
*   Try to define what you need help with:
    *   Is there something in particular you want to do?
    *   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
    *   Is there a concept you don‚Äôt understand?
*   Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox][cs] or video, if possible
*   Screenshots can help, but if there‚Äôs important text such as code or error
    messages in them, please also provide those as text
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community. ‚úåÔ∏è

## :wine_glass: Contributions and Supports

With pleasure to accept your patches and contributions to various open-source or software projects. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow before making a change.

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.
